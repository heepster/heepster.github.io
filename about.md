# Hi!


I'm Kevin and I'm a software engineer based in LA.

On my free time I like to [make music](/music) and [draw stuff](/illustration).

<br />

## Things I Use

I usually use Linux to make things, and, unless otherwise stated, all software mentioned here run on Linux -- yes, even the virtual instruments (via [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and [Yabridge](https://github.com/robbert-vdh/yabridge))!

<br />

### General
* [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) -- text editors
* [Excalidraw.com](https://excalidraw.com/) -- for diagramming
* [Ansible](https://docs.ansible.com/) -- managing dotfiles and keeping my computers / servers (relatively) reproducible.  You can check out my ansible configs [here](https://github.com/heepster/dotfiles).

<br />
